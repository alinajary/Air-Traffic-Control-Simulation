# Air-Traffic-Control-Simulation
#One day in 2050, you are the air traffic controller sitting at the control tower at ATL, enjoying your
#morning coffee. Suddenly, you receive a radio call saying that an airplane, A1, declares an emergency
#and needs to land first. Now, you look at the radar map in Figure 1 and realize that the aircraft is
#not the first in the landing queue. Your job is to land and park all three aircrafts in minimal time,
#without violating any airspace, runway and taxiway rule or regulation, with A1 being the first to land
#and park at P3. The optimal landing order after A1 lands is for you to determine as well.
