# Air-Traffic-Control-Simulation
One day in 2050, you are the air traffic controller sitting at the control tower at ATL, enjoying your
morning coffee. Suddenly, you receive a radio call saying that an airplane, A1, declares an emergency
and needs to land first. Now, you look at the radar map in Figure 1 and realize that the aircraft is
not the first in the landing queue. Your job is to land and park all three aircrafts in minimal time,
without violating any airspace, runway and taxiway rule or regulation, with A1 being the first to land
and park at P3. The optimal landing order after A1 lands is for you to determine as well.

we have some constrains in this project as in the airport environment you could not do everything you 
want. these constrains is applied to the simulations.
